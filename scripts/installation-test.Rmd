## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Install packages

**This code will NOT run when the document is knitted. Tun this before knitting!!**

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("here")
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("rmarkdown")
install.packages("rmdformats")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
```

## Load packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

## Summary

```{r cars}
summary(mpg)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
mpg %>%
  filter(displ > 2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = displ, y = cty)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Read in a dataset 

```{r}
test = read.csv(here("data", "penguins.csv"))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
